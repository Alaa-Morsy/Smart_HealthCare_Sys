# Smart_HealthCare_Sys
The IOT Based Health Care System is a healthcare device based on the IOT platform for the patients and doctors.
It provides measurements of body parameters like ECG, Temperature, Oxygen saturation, Heartbeat.
This system also generates an alert when it is required that means at the time of any critical conditions and notifications about the medicines, fall detection, conditions, etc.

In this project we are using Rasperry Pi Model 3 B+
-> Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs).
    it feature a system on a chip (SoC) with an integrated ARM-compatible central processing unit (CPU) and on-chip graphics processing unit (GPU)
    Architecture : Quad-core 64-bit ARM cortex A53 CPU
    Programming Language : Python3

The Sensors Used :
1.   Body temperature sensor 
2.   Heart pulse sensor 
3.   Pulse oximeter sensor
4.   Electrocardiogram sensor
5.   Fall detection sensor
